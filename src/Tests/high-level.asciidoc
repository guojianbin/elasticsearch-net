= NEST - High level client

[partintro]
--
The high level client, `ElasticClient`, provides a strongly typed query DSL that maps one-to-one with the Elasticsearch query DSL.

It can be installed from the Package Manager Console inside Visual Studio using

[source, shell]
----
Install-Package NEST
----

Or by searching for https://www.nuget.org/packages/NEST[NEST] in the Package Manager GUI. 

NEST internally uses and still exposes the low level client, `ElasticLowLevelClient`, from <<elasticsearch-net,Elasticsearch.Net>> via
the `.LowLevel` property on `ElasticClient`.

There are a number of conventions that NEST uses for inference of

- <<index-name-inference, Index Names>>
- <<indices-paths, Building a URI path to one or more indices>>
- <<field-inference, Field names>> and <<property-inference, Property names>>
- <<ids-inference, Document IDs>>
- <<document-paths, Building a URI path to a document>>
- <<features-inference, API features>>

As well as a number of types for working with

- <<time-units, Time Units>>
- <<distance-units, Distance Units>>
- <<date-math-expressions, Date Math>>

And features such as

- <<auto-map, Auto Mapping C# types>>
- <<covariant-search-results, Covariant Search Results>>

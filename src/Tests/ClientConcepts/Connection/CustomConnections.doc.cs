		* == Custom Connection Implementations
		*
		* The client abstracts sending the request and creating a response behind `IConnection`
		*
		* By default the client will use a WebRequest based version on the desktop CLR (.NET 4.5 and up targets)
		* and a HttpClient based connection specifically built for the Core CLR (netstandard 1.3).
		*
		* The reason for the split is because `WebRequest` and `ServicePoint` are not directly available on netstandard 1.3.
		*
		* The dekstop CLR implementation using `WebRequest` is the most matured implementation that we weren't ready to it give up.
		* There are also a couple of important toggles that are easy to set against a `ServicePoint` that we'd have to give up
		* had we jumped on the `HttpClient` completely.
		*
		* Another limitation is that `HttpClient` has no synchronous code paths and supporting that means doing hacky async patches which definitely
		* need time to bake.
		*
		* So why would you ever want to pass your own `IConnection`? Let's look at a couple of examples
		*

		 * Here we create a new `ConnectionSettings` by using the overload that takes a `IConnectionPool` and an `IConnection`.
		 * We pass it an `InMemoryConnection` which using this constructor will return 200 for everything and never actually perform any IO.
		 *
		 * `InMemoryConnection` is great to write unit tests with as there is another overload that takes a fixed response stream to return.
		 *
		 * === ServicePoint hacking
		 *
		 * If you are running on the desktop CLR you can override specific properties for the current `ServicePoint` easily by overriding
		 * `AlterServicePoint` e.g to change the default connection limit to a specific endpoint from 80 to something higher.
		 * Remember though that we reuse TCP connections so changing this to something really high should only be done with careful consideration.

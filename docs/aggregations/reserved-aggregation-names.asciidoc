== Reserved Aggregation Names

NEST uses a heuristics based parser to parse the aggregations back in to typed responses
Therefor some of the key properties we use to make a decision on are not allowed as key names

Elasticsearch 5.x will at some point get a flag that returns the aggregations in a parsable
fashion at which point this limitation will be lifted

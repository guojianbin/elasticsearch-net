.GeoShapeEnvelope(c => c
    .Name("named_query")
    .Boost(1.1)
    .Field(p=>p.Location)
    .IgnoreUnmapped()
    .Coordinates(this._coordinates)
    .Relation(GeoShapeRelation.Intersects)
)

----
new GeoShapeEnvelopeQuery
{
    Name = "named_query",
    Boost = 1.1,
    Field = Field<Project>(p=>p.Location),
